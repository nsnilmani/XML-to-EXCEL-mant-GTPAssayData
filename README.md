# XML-to-EXCEL-mant-GTPAssayData
This program is specific for mant-GTP GEF assay performed with SpectraMax Gemini XPS Microplate Reader. 

This program takes the .xml file generated by running this assay on SpectramaxGemini plate reader as input and geneartes an Excel file as output. 

In the GEF assay (xml file), for each well, there is two distinct fluorescence emission values a) Background and b) after addition of GEF 
accompanied; each measurement starts at time zero (t=0)

The output combines both fluorescent emission and corresponding time into columns next to each other. 
It also combines fluorescence emission values before and after GEF addition into one column.

The output data shows time in seconds for each measurement. The time wil start at 0 whenever the measurements have been re-started. 
The output excel file has name of input file with .xlsx
